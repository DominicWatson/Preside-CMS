/**
 * Website benefits can be tagged against website users (see :doc:`website_user`).
 * Pages in the site tree, assets in the asset manager, and other custom access areas can then be
 * tagged with member benefits to control users' access to multiple areas and actions in the site through their benefits.
 *
 * This is also a useful object to extend so that you could add other types of benefits other than page / asset access. For
 * example, you could have a disk space field that can tell the system how much disk space a user has in an uploads folder or
 * some such.

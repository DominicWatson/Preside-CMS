title: Task manager - ad-hoc tasks (10.9.0 and above)
---

As of v10.9.0, PresideCMS allows you to create, run and optionally track, ad-hoc background tasks. For example, the core data export and form builder export functionality now runs in the background and uses a core Preside admin view to track and deliver the final download.

For predefined scheduled tasks, see [[taskmanager-predefinedtasks]].

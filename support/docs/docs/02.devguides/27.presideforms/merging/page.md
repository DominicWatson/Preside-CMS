## Merging Preside form definitions

One of the key features of PresideCMS is the ability to augment and override features defined in the core and in extensions. The forms system is no different and allows any form definition to be modified by both extensions and your application. 

To modify an existing form definition, you must create a corresponding file under your application or extension's `/forms` directory. For example, if you wanted to modify the core [[form-assetaddform]] that lives at `/forms/preside-objects/asset/admin.add.xml` in the core of preside, you would create an xml file at `/application/forms/preside-objects/asset/admin.add.xml` within your application.

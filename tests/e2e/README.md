# Preside end-to-end test suite

The Preside end-to-end test suite uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to test a running Preside application.

## Running Cypress and executing tests

The process of running the suite locally is:

1. Get the "fullcmsapp" application running using commandbox. You will need to configure a datasource for this.
2. Run Cypress, either from the commandline, or open its GUI to run individual tests and create new ones

### 1. Get the "fullcmsapp" running
